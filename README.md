Hey Guys, Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I am excited to share that I have recently completed the **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** Course. This course covered a variety of topics including Search, Knowledge, Uncertainty, Optimization, Learning, Neural Networks and Language.

All the projects I submitted are in this repository.

The course was challenging but extremely informative and I am grateful for the opportunity to learn from the expert instructors at Harvard. If you are interested in learning more about Artificial Intelligence and Python, I highly recommend checking out the course at the following link: [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/)

Below is my certificate of completion for this course. I am proud of my accomplishment and look forward to applying my knowledge to future projects.
