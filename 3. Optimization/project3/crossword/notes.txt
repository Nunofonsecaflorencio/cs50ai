Contraint Satisfaction Problem

Variable: Each sequence of squeres
Domain: Possible words will fill in that sequence

Each Variable:
    - begin row i
    - begin col j
    - direction (across or down)
    - length

Unary constraint: 
    - length
Binary constraint: 
    - overlap with neighboring variables
        character index in each variableâ€™s word that must be the same character

# all words must be different

GOAL: find a satisfying assignment
